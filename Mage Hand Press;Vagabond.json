First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on a combination of archery and finesse weapons. Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Charisma if you plan to take a subclass, such as Mage Brand, that employs spellcasting or other magical abilities. Finally, choose any background, preferably one that ties into your choice for your Wanderer's Secret feature."
