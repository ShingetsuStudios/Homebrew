Whether on stage or in the heat of battle, such bards perform as a whirling kaleidoscope of character, emotion, and magic, shifting between personas of solitude, war, beauty, and hope. Some bards of this college see their masks as exten sions of their true self, a magnification of their power in a specific direction. Others give themselves completely to the transformation, adopting totally fresh outlooks, personas, and even voices depending on the mask they wear. In either case, each mask grants its own special magic, and with the power to switch between them at will, mask bards have the tools and talents to seize command of any situation."

Saturated in magic, oniborne innately command primal, supernatural forces. In moments of high emotion, instinctive spellcasting is common. An oniborne's retort may physically scold the body of a foe, flesh might reknit under their palms in moments of compassion, or they may physically shrink when gripped with terror.",

Being descendants of the oni, grotesque and dangerous yokai, many other humanoids view oniborne as savage, ugly, violent, and cruel—more akin to demons than their fey ancestors. These are ancient stereotypes, passed from parent to child in bedtime tales of terror. All oniborne, be they virtuous or villainous, suffer under this crude prejudice."

For this reason, many oniborne are drawn to thrilling, high-risk lifestyles, often becoming big game hunters, soldiers of fortune, or travelling performers."
