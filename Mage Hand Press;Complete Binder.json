But the most prominent voice was gruff and confident, which he used to lull his targets into complacency seconds before he struck with a hidden dagger. By the next morning, the gruff, independent voice was gone, instead replaced with a profound melancholy. He discarded the daggers too, in favor of a sturdy spear and imposing armor. The day after that, he struck an air of erratic rage, and he abandoned weapons altogether in favor of eldritch flame. Each morning, he woke up new, possessed by some new infernal spirit, dead god, or forgotten sinner.",

Righteous spirits that are remembered as villains develop a fiendish aspect and sinister overtones, while those who are forgotten fade over millennia into the Void's static. Mercifully, binder scholars record and preserve the original, often apocryphal, tales of these vestiges' origins, allowing them to persist longer in the Void.",

Sharing their soul in this way leaves profound marks as the vestige pushes its way into reality: it influences its binder's personality and usually warps their body in accordance with the vestige's esoteric form. Last, but not least, the soul itself is permanently fractured, which could have unforeseen consequences in the afterlife. It is for this reason that binding magic is usually forbidden.",

With her new spells in hand, she went to visit the icy tower of her mentor, but discovered that his crystal ball was fixed to scry upon her—surely, the old man meant to copy her spells and steal them for himself!

After a week of wandering aimlessly through the sands, Rostam was on the verge of death from dehydration, when he came across a lone woman, a devil in disguise. She offered him a pact for his soul: she would give him food, water, and enough strength to slay the demons. Rostam accepted and was bestowed a living suit of infernal armor: hideous, hairy, and indestructible.",

Each new battle brought Rostam greater glories and new, terrible crimes. He slew every foe he met. One story even claims that he butchered his own son in a fit of rage.",

Rostam himself bled to death, but the armor was not yet finished. It moved of its own accord, wading through the battlefield, slaying friend and foe alike, cackling with infernal cadence. Therefore, Rostam’s vestige is not the hero himself, but the hideous armor, which bleeds from every joint, the corpse of the so-called hero still within."

With decades of work and the assistance of his apprentice, Evocatia the Red, he perfected his masterpiece, a spell so powerful that few mages could lay claim to it: cone of cold. He traveled to his apprentice’s scorching, iron tower to test her mettle with this new spell, but instead discovered that Evocatia’s familiar was a sinister fiend, who tempted her with secrets of hellfire magic. Outraged, Elozahr froze her tower solid and shattered it to bits.",

Then War’Red wished for an army, a million men strong, to spread bloodshed and conquest wherever he turned his gaze. Again, Qadir acquiesced, and legions of foot soldiers sprang into existence around them. Lastly, War’Red wished for immortality, that his reign might be unending. At this, finally, Qadir could comply no longer: he reversed the wishes, banished War’Red to a forsaken desert, and returned to his lamp.",

In a whirlwind of deadly magic, Qadir was obliterated. He lives on only as a vestige, a cautionary tale that you should always honor your promises, no matter the cost"
