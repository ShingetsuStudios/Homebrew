                        "Presented here is an alternative version of the Sorcerer class. This alternative version was founded on a few common criticisms of the Sorcerer class presented in the Player’s Handbook. Namely, the sorcerer class learns too few spells and metamagic feels too scarce to be the single mechanic that differentiates the class from wizards.",
                        "To address these concerns, I took the stance that less change is better. To address the concern about spells known, I simply increased the number sorcerers learned. In the Player’s Handbook version of the class, sorcerers learn a total of 15 spells   4 less than the warlock knows and 10 less than clerics, druids, and wizards can prepare. In this revision, sorcerers can learn a maximum of 20 spells.",
                        "Another minor change was increasing the number of Metamagic options sorcerers learn. In the Player’s Handbook, sorcerers start with 2 metamagic options, eventually learning another at 10th level and again at 17th for a total of 4. Since the predominant way sorcerers are different from other full spellcasters is their ability to manipulate spells, I decided to grant them more metamagics. In this version, sorcerers start with 2 metamagic options and learn another at 4th, 6th, 10th, and 17th level for a total of 6. I have also given each sorcerer archetype its own metamagic option that only sorcerers of that archetype can learn.",
                        "Finally, the biggest departure from the sorcerer class as presented in the Player’s Handbook is changing the class from spell slots to spell points. Many playtesters and reviewers shared the valid concern that if spell points were included it could lead to stagnant gameplay where sorcerers always cast spells at the highest level they can, upcasting every spell. In order to encourage more dynamic spellcasting decisions, the sorcerer’s spell point pool is much smaller than it should be for a full spellcaster but can be refreshed once or twice a day with the Font of Magic feature. This encourages sorcerers to try to squeeze every spell they can out of their pool before refilling it.",
                        "With this spell point refresh mechanic came the possibility to define the sorcerer a bit more. To do that, when a sorcerer uses their font of magic they regain all expended spell points and can temporarily manipulate their spells even more than usual   they can use any number of metamagic options they know on each spell they cast for a minute.",
                        "It is my hope that you will find this alternative version of the Sorcerer class balanced and fun in your campaign. Please be sure to leave a comment on the product page if you have questions or feedback!"

Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.",
                                "Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power."

People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet.

Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know."

As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?",
                                "How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.",
