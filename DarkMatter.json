					"Sometimes seen as a fate worse than death, exile has long been a popular sanction for radicals, dissidents, and troublemakers. Exiling these people allows the authorities to remove a thorn from their sides without creating a martyr or having to keep the unwanted person in costly perpetual captivity. Many a coup or revolution has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the ‘verse.",
					"On occasion, a person may choose exile voluntarily, either as an alternative to something worse or because they desire time on the Frontier to grow and develop. An exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures and contact émigré communities while rallying support remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.",
					"Exiles take to adventuring for a number of reasons. For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all, however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere, with no choice other than to continue wandering forever."
