Mastering this discipline means not only commanding an undead mount, but also requires sure mastery over weapons while on horseback and on foot. However, the reward is immense: a black rider isn't a plodding marshal of shambling masses, but a wind of death that blows across the battlefield at a moment's notice."

These impish martyrs are given license to joke, prank, and romp about the world with extraordinarily vague directives. Perhaps, they have been commanded to pull a prank or tell a joke so ludicrous that history remembers it forever. Or perhaps the martyr is themselves the butt of a larger joke, a walking parable about fate's blunders. Sadly, the martyr's death usually serves as a punchline. "
