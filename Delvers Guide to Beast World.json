An angus can throw their weight into a fight harder than anyone, and the bison physique is suited to wield their enormous weapons. Woe be unto an unlucky drunk in a bar fight with a bull. "

Just as a wizard's staff empowers them, a cervine's physical body anchors them to the Arcana. Elk of every homeland share a cultural curiosity about the mysteries of magic.",
					"Perhaps because of their size or a lingering influence of their origin species, others know cervines to be cautious and to keep their distance in social gatherings. Most cervines are less-than-forthcoming with new people, but it's not impossible to form close relationships with them. Their curiosity has driven them to travel around the world despite their suspicion of strangers. While they are impatient with idle chatter (especially that of wolves), any beast or brethren who can find common ground with an elk makes a devoted friend.",
					"The most famous military force in the Beast World is also its most secretive: the Oric War Mages. The sharpest wizards and strongest fighters in Oria dwell in a hidden stronghold, where they study and train together. While everyone knows about their existence, their identities are a closely guarded secret. Elk are the typical person's image of a War Mage, and cervine delvers who travel beyond the Oric border inevitably face excited questions about the order. Foreigners wonder if they've spotted a War Mage whenever they see an elk with a heavy weapon or one casting arcane spells."

Horses and donkeys share a culture of wandering, seeking new people and opportunities throughout their lives. Some beasts build castles and monuments, but equines are satisfied to see them as they run past. The world has too much beauty to witness to weigh one's life down with stone.",

Their physique is usually more bottom-heavy than a bovine's, with powerful legs built for endurance on the long roads they walk. Horses vary in height much more than donkeys. The shortest members of both subspecies stand around 5'3\". However, while donkeys are rarely taller than 5'10\" or so, horses can tower to 7'5\" or more.",
					"The appearance of the Dungeon has given equines more company on the road than ever. Horses are common in delver caravans and their wandering makes them invaluable scout contacts. They hear more about strange happenings than anyone from the tiny villages on the routes they walk. Their stature and strength make them invaluable members of any crew. They often stand as an impassable wall separating a monster from the fragile, crunchy spellcaster it wants to eat."

					"Felines are Al'ar, and Al'ar is feline. The strong association comes from the islands' remoteness, and that cats were their only willful creatures for centuries. A thousand miles of ocean separates feline culture from the others, and it's inextricable from that of Al'ar itself.",
					"The feline species is split into two subspecies named in the old Al'ari language: grandi and chikitu. These labels are based on physical size— tigers and other big cats are grandi, and smaller shorthairs and other breeds are the chikitu. A softer line separates them than those separating other species. Taller and broader lynxes, for instance, are assumed to be grandi, while smaller members of the same family might identify as chikitu.",
					"Other homelands see cats as a curiosity. The descendents of many chikitu wanderers still live in Vinyot and Allemance, while Arnerian felines are a sight rare enough that other natives will point one out on the street. The reverse is also true—when a wolf introduces himself as Al'ari to a dock town, he expects raised eyebrows and some curious questions about his story.",
					"Compared to other species, felines behave a bit more like their animal ancestors. A typical cat is careful about who they make friends with, and they watch closely before making a move to join with a group. They are the canines' social opposite—a dog spends time alone counting down the hours until they can be with friends again, while felines have an inborn need to decompress and unwind alone. There are plenty of feline party animals, and some altogether lack this tendency, but it's normal for a chikitu friend to decline an invitation in favor of lying on the wagon roof to look up at the stars.",
					"The allure of an early retirement motivates many felines to a life of delving. They love the idea of working a dangerous job for just a few years to earn security and safety for the rest of their lives. Felines of either sort are quick on their feet and make great additions to any delving crew. Grandi largeness makes them a good choice for a front line Point or Rampart (for more information on what these terms mean, see the \"Pictograms\" section on page 396). Chikitu have sharper vision and discernment, and they're great scouts and False Eyes."

Their conversations are a labyrinth of inside references, technically precise descriptions of past events, and long journeys from the topic at hand. Some wizards get on especially well with laetines. Conjurers, tinkerers, and construct builders exercise the same critical thinking laetines apply to every interaction in life.",
					"Laetines are curious and inventive, and there's no better place to flex one's ingenuity than in the Dungeon. The most common motivation for new laetine adventurers is hearing of a new delver innovation. As a popular ferret story goes, when Penelope Clearwater invented the spring-loaded ladder in 1358, one in ten able-bodied noodles started lacing their first delving boots. When it comes to the dungeon's puzzles and maze-like corridors, a laetine mind can be a lifesaving addition to the crew's kit. As an added bonus, their pliable bodies can help out-of-reach treasures find their rightful home in the crew's loot sack."

Every triumph is a chance to bring a trophy home to one's parents and soak in the praise. Many bears have a braggadocious streak, but the drive to climb the highest mountains in life also makes them valuable and motivating friends.",
					"They love competition and sport; every homeland's popular athletic games are a sure place to spot its ursines. Among friends, every open field is a potential race and every battle is a contest to see who can clobber the most foes. A good-natured ursine sees these contests as a way to bond with others through mutual self-improvement. A cruel one lords their victories over their lessers. Ursines' ancestral roots are entangled with Oria's, and in every homeland, family is core to the way a bear sees themselves. An ursine parent rarely hesitates to name their favorite child, and sibling rivalries ignite between cubs and burn throughout a bear's life.",

Then the humans arrived, then the kobolds began to wake themselves up. But bats are another thing altogether. There are no quiet-minded bats in the Astral, so how did they come to be?
