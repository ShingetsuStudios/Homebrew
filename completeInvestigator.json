Even so, an investigator's occupation is perilous. A grimoire might spell out a vampire's fear of sunlight and aversion to silver, but it does little to hinder their fangs."

Such topics in magic are seldom studied, for their very existence poses an existential threat to the multiverse itself: chronomancy, protomancy, and quantumancy are among the few graced with names at all. When a sinister (or merely curious) arcanists pulls on one of these volatile threads of knowledge, they open a Pandora’s box of unpredictable effects; the results are usually catastrophic. Using such dangerous arcana leaves lasting scars on people and objects, metaphysical reverberations from the terrible secrets at their source.",

Their job is hazardous and challenging, but is of critical importance to the multiverse at large. Containment specialists usually coordinate in clandestine groups to triangulate new threats and ensure isolated ones are contained indefinitely. With some luck, these organizations can remain obscure footnotes for generations, further sheltering their secrets from curious eyes."
