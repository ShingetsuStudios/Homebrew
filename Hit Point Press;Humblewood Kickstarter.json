The treants taught the sage about the forest, the creatures they shared it with, and how all are cradled within the Great Rhythm’s embrace. The sage used their teachings to found the Tenders, an order sworn to uphold the balance of natural forces. Although the sage’s name has been lost to history, the Tenders persist to this day.",
                                "As humble caretakers of the Wood, the first Tenders studied the interconnectedness of all life as well as the practice of gentle, natural magic. The treants’ teachings helped the Tenders heal the forest from blights and fires. Following the example of the treants, they tended small village grovesand used their magic to provide support in times of hardship. Possessing a deep insight into the Great Rhythm, the Tenders came to be seen as a bridge between the will of the Wood and the people who lived there. Over a few hundred songs until they became an established presence in the Wood.",
                                "The order faced it’s greatest challenge during the Great Calamity. As fires raged unabated, incinerating nearly a third of Humblewood’s woodland, the Tenders helped those fleeing the blaze. The flames of the Great Calamity forged the Scorched Grove, and the Tenders took it upon themselves to restore the corrupted earth. Their search to correct the elemental imbalance of the Scorched Grove led the Tenders to incorporate disparate schools of magic into their teachings. Most notably they managed to merge the scholarly approach of Avium wizards with the harmonious teachings of their druidic arts. With this new understanding of arcana, the Tenders have made steady progress toward healing the Grove’s corruption.",
                                "As certain Tenders dedicated their lives to healing the Scorched Grove, others pledged to mend the world in different ways. Some organized into a force of first responders to protect the Wood against natural upheavals, while others became healers, teachers, and tree-shapers. Others traveled across Everden, where they discovered lands with dangerous elemental imbalances. This divided the order into distinct chapters, or Branches. Each Branch of the Tenders has an elected leader, called a treekeeper. Once every fifty songs Branch treekeepers convene to share what their Branch has learned. Treekeepers also hold urgent meetings when necessary, but are otherwise absorbed in their most important duty: seeking answers that may heal the damaged areas of Everden.",

They are also diligent sentinels, dedicated to foreseeing and averting threats to this balance, both natural and manufactured. This duty extends to safeguarding hazardous magics and powerful artifacts lest they fall into the wrong hands. When nature summons up storms, floods, or other life-threatening events, the Tenders work to lessen their harm, providing help for those injured or displaced, and repairing damage wrought to the ecosystem. Finally, the Tenders have a duty to tend to areas that have been scarred or corrupted by strong elemental energies. This includes shielding people from the monstrous creatures that live in such areas,and gradually restoring the balance of elemental energies to help the land return to a natural state.",

The Tenders of the Scorched Grove work to heal the flame-scarred western area of Humblewood from which they take their name. Members of this Branch regularly make pilgrimages to the Scorched Grove to learn from the elders there. Some put down roots in the Grove and dedicate their lives to keeping watch over the area. Due to the dangers present in and around the Scorched Grove, this Branch faces greater risks than many other Tender chapters. The Tenders of the Scorched Grove are also trusted to maintain the most extensive records of the order. They are led by a corvum mystic named Janily of the Everchanging Sky. Janily is currently on a spiritual quest to the far corners of Everden, a journey on which she hopes to uncover the secret to healing the Scorched Grove."

Their chapter was founded to contain a spreading expanse of hoarfrost, known as the Crystal Wastes, that persistently encroaches on the Rimewood and the region’s green plains. Initially established by members of the Tenders of the Scorched Grove, this Branch has since grown to differentiate itself through a more contemplative and judicious approach to their duties. They keep a solemn vigil in mighty fortresses, bulwarks against the encroaching ice. They are led by a perceptive and intelligent raptor called Cain of the Sunsworn Oath, who possesses a boundless curiosity.

Their tales tell of a group of locals who were inspired by a traveling treekeeper to take up the task of protecting their rainforest home from harm. The Branch has since organized into a force known throughout the region for their valor and dedication. Most of their number are rangers who live off the land and are experienced in recognizing disturbances in the natural balance. Their leader is a luma known only as Grandmother Orchid, who is rumored to have lived for hundreds of songs. Unlike other treekeepers, Grandmother Orchid only travels when she must convene with other Branch leaders. Tanglewild Tenders say that she spends her days in meditation within the tangled roots of an enormous tree, feeling the pulse of the entire world."

They came from all over the Wood to surround the accursed conflagration. Skilled in the primordial magic of the very first druids, the eldest of their kind used their awesome power to form a barrier against the inferno. Their leaves burned to ash, their bodies charred and splintered.

Indeed, they could often be seen strolling through the hillsides. Each treant with its own grove, tended to the trees and all living things within them. The old stories say it is from the treants that we took our name, for we too aspired to be Tenders of the forest. Being long-lived, they knew much of the Wood’s history, and, though towering creatures, not even the smallest seed escaped their notice. Above all else, they were teachers, and that is what Tenders must strive to be. With the eldest and wisest of the treants lost to the flames, we must take their place, not only as keepers of lore and stewards of nature, but as those who tend to the very spirit of this world.",

                "This strange device was made by a mapach tinkerer and uses its powerful enchantment as a power supply. It resembles two folded wings, made of brass and cloth, attached to a box containing an intricate array of gears and cogs. This box has leather straps which allow it to be worn across the back, and two brass levers which can be cranked by the wearer. The entire device weighs only 20 lbs. While wearing the device, you can crank the left lever using an action to activate the wings, causing them unfurl and flap. Cranking the left lever again as an action stops the wings movement and causes them to fold back into their original position.",
                "While the wings are in motion, you have a fly speed of 60 feet. This fly speed is reduced to 30 feet if your combined weight, with your gear (worn and carried), is over 150 lbs. If your combined weight, with your gear, is over 250 lbs, you can't use this item to fly. Once activated, the wings will function until you stop their motion by cranking the left lever again. You can use the device to fly for up to 1 hour, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one reducing the duration by a minimum of 1 minute. If you are flying when the duration expires, you fall to the ground, taking damage as normal.",
                "You can crank the right lever as a reaction to cause the wings to extend out to the sides, allowing you to glide safely to the earth. Cranking it a second time as a reaction causes the wings to fold back into their original position. If you are falling while the wings are extended in this way, you immediately stop falling and descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land. This speed is increased to 60 feet if your combined weight with your gear (worn and carried) is over 150 lbs. Using this lever doesn't count towards the flight duration, however if it is cranked while the wings are in motion it will still slow your fall, though there is a 50 percent chance the device will fail. If this occurs the device will become completely useless for {@dice 2d12} hours after you've landed.",

It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as \"200 feet straight downward\" or \"upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet.\" In order for the teleportation to succeed, you must arrive in an area of dim light or darkness, otherwise you are teleported to the nearest such area within range. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creatures or objects you wished to bring with you fail to teleport. After you use this property roll {@dice 1d6}. On a roll of 6 you can't use it again until the next dusk."
