Her hands and feet are heavily callused from years of perfecting her martial craft, and her eyes are closed as her perfectly honed senses feel the movment of the air around her. She opens her eyes, and in a single move drops, slamming her fist into a large hunk of granite. The stone shatters into rubble, and the woman smiles.",

Seeing the commotion, a thickly-muscled tiefling gets up from the bench they had been lying on. They smile to themselves as they tighten the straps on the fingerless gloves they were wearing, and rush towards the first raider, grabbing him and flinging him out the entrance like a shot-put.",
