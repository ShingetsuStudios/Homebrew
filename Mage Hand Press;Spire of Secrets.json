You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be selftaught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character's history with magic. Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot? Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal? Lastly, consider your prospective warmage house. Though you don't choose one until reaching third level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights."

                                "Necromancers have learned through trial and error how to puppet the flesh, bone, and spirits of the dead, binding them to their will. Through their terrible magic, they command the forms of lesser undead, and demand respect from those powerful enough to resist their thrall. All necromancers share the capability of simply animating corpses, along with the knowledge and foresight to create new and terrible undead abominations to further their goals. Beyond the basic command over the undead, each necromancer specializes in a method to impart their will upon the world. Some dive deeply into the necromantic arts, whereas others focus on their ability to assert control over others, while others still master the art of both martial and magical combat. While their skills might seem specialized, properly prepared necromancers can dominate both on the battlefield and at the round table. "

These three features define the warden's unique style, but this need not be the only style for the warden's combat. You can use the following sets of alternate class features in place of the warden's core features to entirely pivot its style of play to your preference.",

Druids who join the ancient Circle of Stones carry on the tradition of raising stone henges in places of great power, where leylines intersect and magic strengthens. Such locations are marked as nexuses of power, where the Forgotten Laws of the Old Gods is still heeded-but such things are known only to a few druids today. All others see the looming stone monuments as enigmatic circles, and a grim reminder of the enormity of time."

The sphere deals 4d10 radiant damage to anything it touches, disintegrating nonmagical objects it reduces to 0 hit points.

You can create an alchemy golem in an 8-hour long procedure, which can be conducted over the course of a long rest. To complete this process, you must have a healer's kit, alchemist's supplies, and a knife (or a facility with access to such tools), as well as at least three recently deceased humanoid corpses.",

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command your golem if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the golem will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the golem only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the golem continues to follow it until its task is complete.",

On each of your turns, you can command the mouth to float up to 30 feet (no action required) and you can use your bonus action to command it to bite a creature within 5 feet of it. The mouth uses your spell attack bonus for its melee attack roll and on a hit deals {@dice 4d10} force damage and grapples its target (escape DC equals your spell save DC) on a hit. The mouth can grapple only one target at a time, and can only attack the creature it is grappling.",

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, and it takes {@dice 4d6} acid damage at the beginning of each of its turns. The creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC to escape. On a success, it magically reappears and falls prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mouth. The creature automatically escapes when the mouth vanishes.",
                "The mouth disappears after 1 minute, or if you dismiss it early on your turn (no action required). Once you summon the mouth, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest."
