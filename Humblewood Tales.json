        "Every druid has a responsibility to the natural world, but those who join the Circle of the Warden stand as sentinels of nature's balance. The Circle of the Warden druids specialize in divination and abjuration magic to help foresee possible imbalances and correct them before they cause irreparable damage. To the druids of this circle, people are as much a part of the natural balance as plants and animals. As such, these druids can be found providing succor to those affected by natural disasters just as often as to flora and fauna. In Humblewood, many druids who have joined the Tenders of the Scorched Grove are members of this circle, as its values align quite closely with the tenets of their order. "

One day, while wandering alone in the Wood at night, they met Tyton, who had come to collect their soul. Rather than accept their death with dignity, the sage instead debated with Tyton about the unfairness of mortality. Tyton could not deny their logic, but warned the heedless sage about disrupting the cycle of lifeand death. He wove a cloak from the fabric of the night sky itself, infused it with a small fraction of his power, and gifted it to the sage. With this, the sage could live forever. Tyton declared that he would return in a century, and if the sage still felt the same, the Amaranthine of death would never again visit them. For a hundred years, the sage watched everyone around them gradually age, succumbing to illness and death as they lived on. In the end, the sage understood their folly and asked for Tyton to guide them peacefully into the hereafter. It is said that Tyton left the Shroud of Ending in the world as a reminder of the sage's foolishness.",
