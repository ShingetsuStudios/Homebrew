               "Wherever there are interesting animals to talk to, you'll find a sheep somewhere nearby making conversation. These gentle and uncomplicated folks are equally common in every homeland. Sheep are born with a unique blessing from the goddess Pirhoua: the ability to communicate with animals. Most sheep keep faithful pets as friends and conversation partners throughout their lives. The most common pet is a pig, whose minds can absorb and retain more ideas than some other potential companions.",
               "Ovines invented the term \"quiet-minded beasts\" to describe the animals of the world. The term comes from the simple, quiet thoughts that animals express. Creatures driven by instinct don't have the same elaborate motivations and nuanced thoughts as their willful counterparts. Sheep recognize the value of their freedom from strife and anxiety, and have great respect for animal life.",
               "Ovines are tuned into a reality most only have a passing awareness of, but impatient folks might think them dull-witted. A sheep's priorities rarely include formal learning and intellectual study. Their love for peaceful life among the herd is incompatible with the conniving of Allemagnian street hustlers or savvy Vinyotian trade moguls.",
               "But sheep aren't stupid! Their patience affords them wisdom and perception of the world around them.",
               "Their gentle nature and tendency to take things slow makes them the friends of the eccentric ligonines. In particular, sheep and sloths tend to meet for the first time just as one might chatter with an old friend. In the opposite manner, laetines are sometimes impatient with ovines on their crew. A ferret's mind races in a dozen directions, and they find sheep impossible to drag along on their mental tangents.",
               "Appropriately, sheep have unrivaled shepherding skills. A flock is well-understood and obedient in the care of an ovine rancher. They also enjoy work as shopkeepers or any other job with ample opportunities for long, thoughtful gazes into the distance.",
               "Wooly delvers often have a close relationship to nature or practice druidic magic. Indeed, sheep druids are gravely concerned about the Dungeon's effects on the natural world. They ally themselves with crews to seek any possible way to reverse the blight an entrance might inflict on local flora and fauna."
